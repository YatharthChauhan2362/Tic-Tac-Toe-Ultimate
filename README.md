# Tic-Tac-Toe Ultimate

This repository contains the code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows players to compete against each other.

## Problem

The problem this project aims to solve is to provide a platform for players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other. Often, players want to play games with their friends or family members, and Tic-Tac-Toe is a popular choice. Tic-Tac-Toe Ultimate aims to make it easy for players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other online.

## Solution

We have developed a web application that allows players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other online. The application has a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy to play the game. Players can create an account, log in, and start playing against other players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three in a row wins.
